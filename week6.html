          <p>This week I worked extensively on my hifi and finalised my branding.
            I took mentoring sessions and spoke to a couple of my classmates and made some improvements to my design. I did fall a little behind on the sprint because I struggled with some of the ux flows and design for my hifi. But I will make up for that on the weekend.

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">02</h3>
          <p>When designing my hifi - So turning my lofi into hifi by adding colours, I noticed that  my lofi prototype wasn't really polished enough and I found myself still designing and thinking of the ux process more than I wish I had which delayed the design process for my hifi.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">03</h3>
          <p>I need to put more work in the early stages and make sure I am settled on a certain idea or have a clearer idea before I go into the branding and prototyping to make sure I don't waste too much time. This term I've truly felt the importance of ux research and why understanding the user is improtant. Probably because my idea is quite niche and there's no solution to this probelm out there at all which led me to have to conduct more research and testing and emphasising with the user more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">04</h3>
          <p>For the next sprint which is the development week, I will make sure I keep track of where I am at with the coding so when I take a break I can just pick up from where I stopped and make sure I always know where I am and what I have to work on next. </p>
