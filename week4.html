          <h3 class="retro-number">01</h3>
          <p>This week I worked on the branding and finalised the lofi prototype. I was able to complete the tasks assigned to us on time and I was able to create a brand. I went back a couple of times to refine it while looking at competitors and taking inspiration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">02</h3>
          <p>It took a really long time for me to settle on certain colours and I should have tested them in real situations to better visualise how they fit with my brand. I struggle with choosing the right colour and seeing how it fits. Finding a better way to test the colours could help next time. My tone for the pitch presentation wasn't convincing so for the next presentation I need to work on my tone and how I present my work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">03</h3>
          <p>My workflow can be improved to streamline each of my processes and not waste time and not get distracted. I need to work on my presentation tone and how I present my work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">04</h3>
          <p>For the next sprint I will continue what I am doing making sure I plan my work to ensure I am on track and know what to focus on next.</p>
