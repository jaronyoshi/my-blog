      <h2 class="section-title">Weekly Retrospective</h2>
      <div class="retrospective-items">
        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">01</h3>
          <p>This week, I tried my best to break down the strucuture oof my presentation and really focus on the tone of the presentation and the message I wanted to convey. In my last presentation I was told that my presentation wasn't really pitching and rather like a student so that's where my focus was. I had just gone to the start up weekend event so I learnt a lot about how to pitch and what sort of content I should have in my pitch presentation and I feel that I executed that pretty well.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">02</h3>
          <p>Looking back at the whole term rather than just this week, I feel that my biggest weakness is branding and designing the user interface. I feel I failed to design the app and brand for the purpose and the problem it is solving. I took a long time to even come up with the design I eventually decided going with and I am not even slightly happy with it. I still don't know how to get better at it besides just practicing and repeating over and over again.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">03</h3>
          <p>Again looking back at the whole term, I noted down which areas I need to focus on for next term. For researchm I need to make sure I ask the right questions and make sure I ask the 5 why's. I also need to try and have a even better understanding of my audience before I go into design next time. As mentioned before I feel I am terrible at brandong and UI so I need to work on that.
            Another aprt I found difficult was layout in the UI. I also need to learn how components and variants work in figma.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">04</h3>
          <p>Next term is a client brief and branding is provided so I am looking forward to working on the ux/ui interactive part and working in a team.</p>
