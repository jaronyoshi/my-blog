          <p>Yesterday I started developing the hifi prototype.
I was able to set up the files and put the webapp on netlify and connect everything to my github repository and to download it as a pwa to test the spacing and size on my phone.

Today I will continue with the development.

It took a long time to set the file up adn host it but it’s all ready now so it should be way quicker now.</p>

          <p>Yesterday I was coding my hifi and I ran into a lot of problems and I struggled quite a lot but eventually I was able to figure out a solution. I also tried to integrate the database into my code but it didn’t work. I was stuck on that for a couple of hours so I decided to skip that and continue coding.

Today I will continue coding.

Finding it hard to get the right layout. (because the code I write isn’t clean and messy.</p>

Today I will continue coding my app hifi and do my type here brief.

          <p>Yesterday I completed coding the hifi but it still has a lot of mistakes and uneven layout and it’s a little glitchy.

Today I start working on the final presentation and code my supporters page.

          <h3 class="retro-number">01</h3>
          <p>This week, I was able to almost finish coding my hifi and to get that out of the way before start up weekend. I felt pretty stressed trying to get as much done before next week.  I was able to accomplish all of my sprint goals as I had planned each day pretty well and setting objectives, ensuring I stay on track.

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">02</h3>
          <p>When coding my hifi prototype, I didn't think of a clear strucutre for the code before starting to code each onboarding page which led to a lot of layout and spacing issues and having to go back and fix everything so far has been very tedious and time consuming. Next time kind of planning my code structure I think will prevent this from happening again.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">03</h3>
          <p>I learnt that coding also requires planning and not just going straight into it (for me at least). Also as I was looking at my figma file in dev mode while coding the hifi, I found that optismising and designing my figma file for when I code the hifi is really important and can save a lot of time. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">04</h3>
          <p>Next sprint I will continure setting daily objectives to ensure I stay on track and try and get as much done for the final week and submission!</p>
