        <h3>Daily stand up</h3>
        <h4>Monday</h4>
        <p>Over the weekend I brainstormed teh exact features
          and create a sitemap. <br>
          Today I will start working on the lofi prototype. <br>
          For blockers I was stuck and wasn’t sure what sort of UI elements to use for the lofi design as I am still in the early stage so that slowed me down a lot.
        </p>
        <h4>Tuesday</h4>
        <p>Yesterday I worked on my prototype and found out that I need to do a bit more research and figure out what kind of questions I need to ask for the support form.Today I will continue working on the lofi prototype.No blockers.
        </p>
        <h4>Wednesday</h4>
        <p>Yesterday I worked on my lofi and did some more research on the questions to ask for the support form.

          Today I will work on the support page of my lofi even more.
          
          No blockers today.
        </p>
        <h4>Thursday</h4>
        <p>Yesterday I worked on the support page for my lofi and refined a couple of pages.

          Today I will complete my lofi prototype.
          
          No blockers
        </p>
        <h4>Friday</h4>
        <p>Yesterday I completed my lofi prototype adn refined it.

          Today I will work on the type brief and finalise my concept idea and build my proof of concept.
          
          Had a hard time coming up with a good idea for my type brief as my focus hasn’t really been on this at all.

        <h3>Weekly Retrospective</h3>
        <h3>01</h3>
        <p>This week I started working on my lofi and I found a lot of parts to improve in my design after conducting user testing. I also started with my moodboard for the branding ans style scape. I planned the week well which is what contributed to a successful week.</p>
        <h3>02</h3>
        <p>It's a good thing actually, but I had to go back and fix so many parts of my lofi protoype so that took a lot longer than what I had initially planned on my calendar but I was able to catch up with some work on the weekend.</p>
        <h3>03</h3>
        <p>I think planning the week better - not just writing down what to do for the week but also already have the templates ready adn set in my figjam could have made the workflow during the week a lot better.</p>
        <h3>04</h3>
        <p>For next week, I will have the templates ready in my figjam to ensure I do not waste time agian looking for the right templates when documenting my design proccess.</p>
