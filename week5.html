          <p>Today after the mentoring with Melody, I decided to work on the Hifi because I was stuck on the logo and didn’t know how to proceed. Got stuck on logo and colours so will skip that and comeback to it later.</p>

          <p>Yesterday I worked on the my brand and stylescape. Today I will work on my hifi and my brand. I really struggled with trying to come up with a simpler logo for my brand. I experimented with multiple other logos but nothing has really clicked for me yet.</p>

          <p>Yesterday I worked on the hifi and brand. Today I will work on my hifi prototype and apply the brand colours to the hifi. I really struggled withe using the right shade of green for my UI. Some looks too dark, too bright, got stuck and am still trying to figure out how to apply brand colours to UI. Balancing dark mode but also trying to make it visually engaging is something I’m finding very difficult.</p>

Still struggling with branding and finding the right colours to make the hifi look good in dark mode.</p>

          <h3 class="retro-number">01</h3>
          <p>This week I worked on the branding and finalised the lofi prototype. I was able to complete the tasks assigned to us on time and I was able to create a brand. I went back a couple of times to refine it while looking at competitors and taking inspiration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">02</h3>
          <p>It took a really long time for me to settle on certain colours and I should have tested them in real situations to better visualise how they fit with my brand. I struggle with choosing the right colour and seeing how it fits. Finding a better way to test the colours could help next time. My tone for the pitch presentation wasn't convincing so for the next presentation I need to work on my tone and how I present my work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">03</h3>
          <p>My workflow can be improved to streamline each of my processes and not waste time and not get distracted. I need to work on my presentation tone and how I present my work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">04</h3>
          <p>For the next sprint I will continue what I am doing making sure I plan my work to ensure I am on track and know what to focus on next.</p>
