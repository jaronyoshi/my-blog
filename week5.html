          <p>Today after the mentoring with Melody, I decided to work on the Hifi because I was stuck on the logo and didn’t know how to proceed. Got stuck on logo and colours so will skip that and comeback to it later.</p>

          <p>Yesterday I worked on the my brand and stylescape. Today I will work on my hifi and my brand. I really struggled with trying to come up with a simpler logo for my brand. I experimented with multiple other logos but nothing has really clicked for me yet.</p>

          <p>Yesterday I worked on the hifi and brand. Today I will work on my hifi prototype and apply the brand colours to the hifi. I really struggled withe using the right shade of green for my UI. Some looks too dark, too bright, got stuck and am still trying to figure out how to apply brand colours to UI. Balancing dark mode but also trying to make it visually engaging is something I’m finding very difficult.</p>

          <h3 class="retro-number">01</h3>
          <p>This week I worked on the branding and I was able to almost complete my branding and started with the hifi production. I couldn't achieve my sprint goal because I really struggled with branding and spent way too much time on it. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">02</h3>
          <p>I spent way too much time on branding and trying to figure out the right colour for the UI on the app. I tested multiple shades of green but even with what I ended up choosing, I am not too happy with it. After mentoring I decided to take a little break from branding and moved on to hifi production which gave me a little fresh break from it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">03</h3>
          <p>I learnt that if I get stuck and don't know what to do, I tend to still try and push through and that usually works but with the creative branding side I really do need to take a break and work on something else to come back with a fresh perspective.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">04</h3>
          <p>Next week I will not let myself work on something for too long and waste time if I get stuck and always make sure I'm makking progress.</p>
