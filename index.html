          <p>Yesterday I tried my best to understand the brief. Today I will continue working on the brief. Brainstorming an idea for the problem statement is something I am finding very difficult due to the overwhelming amount of freedom given for this summative.</p>

          <p>Today we learnt about agile and sprints and how teams work together efficiently. Today I will ideate to come up with ideas for my problem statement. Still finding it difficult to come up with the right idea as it is something I will be working on for two months so I want to make sure I choose the right problem to tackle.</p>

          <p>Yesterday I learnt about agile and how teams can work together efficiently. Today I will come up with a problem statement. I am stuck between two ideas and not 100% sure which one to go with.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Yesterday I narrowed down my ideas for my problem statement. Today I will conduct research and start drafting my research goals so I can start conducting user interviews over the weekend and next week. I am struggling to be productive due to the overwhelming amount of work and having to juggle three different assignments.</p>

          <h3 class="retro-number">01</h3>
          <p>This week I didn't have too many things going well for me. At the bare minimum I was able to come up with an idea that I am somewhat satisfied with and I think is an interesting topic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">02</h3>
          <p>I felt very unsure on which steps to take next at every stage of the process due to not having a clear structure and instructions given to us. I had to look at my past summatives to see which steps I took and that wasted a lot of time and I wish I was able to allocate that time on work rather than navigating my way on what to do next.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">03</h3>
          <p>Having a clear structure and saving all the templates and having a more organised figma file in my past summatives would have cut down the time I spent on figuring out which steps to take next.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="retro-item">
          <h3 class="retro-number">04</h3>
          <p>For the next steps I will plan so I don't get stuck and waste my time as we do not have much time next week due to the WIP.</p>
