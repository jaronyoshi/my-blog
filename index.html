        <h3>Daily stand up</h3>
        <h4>Monday</h4>
        <p>I read the brief and tried my best to understand the requirements for this term.
          Understanding the brief is the blocker for today.
        </p>
        <h4>Tuesday</h4>
        <p>Yesterday I tried my best to understabnd the brief.
          Today I will continue working on the brief.
          Brainstorming an idea for the problem statement is something I am finding very difficult due to the overwhelming amount of freedom given for this summative.
        </p>
        <h4>Wednesday</h4>
        <p>Today we learnt  about agile and sprints and how teams work together effeciently.
          Today I will ideate to come up with ideas for my problem statement.
          Still finding it difficult to come up with the right idea as it is something I will be working on for two months so I want to make sure I choose the right problem to tackle.
        </p>
        <h4>Thursday</h4>
        <p>Yesterday I learnt about agile and how teams can work together effeciently.
          Today I will come up with a problem statement.
          I am stuck between two ideas and not a 100% sure which one to go with.
        </p>
        <h4>Friday</h4>
        <p>Yesterday I narrowed down my ideas for my problem statement.
          Today I will conduct research and start drafting my research goals so I can start conducting user interviews over the weekend and next week.
          I am struggling to be productive due to the overwhelming amount of work and having to juggle three different assignments.

        <h3>Weekly Retrospective</h3>
        <h3>01</h3>
        <p>This week I didn't have too many things going well for me. At the bare minimum I was able to come up with an idea that I am somewhat satisfied with and I think is an interesting topic.</p>
        <h3>02</h3>
        <p>I felt very unsure on which steps to take next at every stage of the process due to not having a clear structure and instructions given to us.
          I had to look at my past summatives to see which steps I took and that wasted a lot of time and I wish I was able to allocate that time on work rather than navigating my way on what to do next.
        </p>
        <h3>03</h3>
        <p>Having a clear structure and saving all the templates and having a more orgaised figma file in my past summatives woudl have cut down the time I spent on figuring out which steps to take next.</p>
        <h3>04</h3>
        <p>For the next steps I will plan so I don't get stuck and waste my time as we do not have much time next week due to the WIP.
