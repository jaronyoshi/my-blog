        <h3>Daily stand up</h3>
        <h4>Monday</h4>
        <p>Today I will work on the WIP presentation slides and summarise the key insights from my ux interview and start working on a solution idea.
        I have been finding it difficult to progress today as I am not confident in my ability to brainstorm as I feel that my ideas are not too good today.
        </p>
        <h4>Tuesday</h4>
        <p>Yesterday I started with the wip presentation and started summarising the interview.

          No blockers today.
        </p>
        <h4>Thursday</h4>
        <p>Yesterday I completed my WIP presentation and submitted it

          Today I will work on competitor research and the type here brief
          
          It was really hard to me to spend time on the type here brief as my I struggled to come up with more creative ideas to come up with for the interactive poster.
        </p>
        <h4>Friday</h4>
        <p>Yesterday I worked on competitor research and filled out the social business canvas.

        <h3>Weekly Retrospective</h3>
        <h3>01</h3>
        <p>This week I was able to complete my sprint goal as I desired with very little blockers.
          I feel keeping track of the tasks that I was working on and setting up the next tasks to do for the next day really helped me stay on track.
        </p>
        <h3>02</h3>
        <p>I did pretty well this week, I submitted everything in time and I was on track with everything and wasn't behind at all. Good project management is to thank for that.
        I did have to go and find some templates from last term and ended wasting a little time on that but nothing major.
        </p>
        <h3>03</h3>
        <p>I am still in the process of finding "my way" of keeping track of my progress and upcoming tasks and managing time so I think if I continue using a gannt chart and to do list, I will soon find the best way to do everything.</p>
        <h3>04</h3>
        <p>For the next sprint I will continue keeping track of my progress and next steps, I will make sure to prepare my interview participants in time for the user testing next week to make sure I have enough time to summarise all the findings and make improvements before going into developement.
